# Band Program Website Template - Claude Reference

## Tech Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript + shadcn/ui
- SQLite + Prisma ORM
- Better Auth authentication (parents and directors)
- Stripe payments (handles own emails)
- Umami analytics (self-hosted)
- Google Calendar integration
- Docker deployment

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Student-Parent Matching System
- **Privacy-first**: No student name dropdowns to prevent data leaks
- **Fuzzy matching**: Backend matches parent input against director's CSV roster
- **Real-time feedback**: "Match found!" or "Manual verification needed"
- **Director review**: Dashboard for unmatched registrations with manual linking

### Payment System Design (t3dotgg Pattern)
- **t3dotgg Architecture**: Single source of truth with `syncStripeDataToUser()` function - no complex webhook state management
- **Stripe Checkout Sessions**: Pre-created customer IDs, hosted payment pages for PCI compliance
- **Two-step flow**: Parents enroll students in categories first, then make payments in configured increments
- **Payment increments**: Band Fees ($250 full), Spring Trip ($900 in $50 increments), Equipment ($150 in $25 increments)
- **Guest checkout support**: Non-authenticated users can make payments with strict student name matching
- **Ghost accounts**: Automatic account creation for unmatched payments, convertible to real accounts
- **Notes system**: Optional notes for student payments, required notes for donations
- **General Fund**: Special student record for handling donations and arbitrary contributions

### Configuration Approach
- **File-based only**: JSON configuration for white-label customization
- **No web admin**: Director cannot change branding/settings through website
- **Developer setup**: Configuration changes require file editing and redeployment

### File Management
- **Simple model**: Director uploads, parents download
- **Category-based**: Starting with "Forms" category
- **Deprecation support**: Director can archive outdated files
- **No versioning**: Simple file replacement workflow

### Calendar Integration
- **External management**: Director maintains Google Calendar separately
- **Website display**: Embedded calendar view with subscription options
- **Public access**: Calendar viewable without login
- **No RSVP or event management**: Display and sync only

### Dashboard Architecture
- **Unified dashboard**: Single `/dashboard` URL for all authenticated users
- **Role-based content**: Different interfaces shown based on user role (parent vs director)
- **Server-side role detection**: User role determines which dashboard component renders
- **Seamless experience**: No confusion about where to go after login

## Important Workflows

### Director Workflow
1. Upload student roster (CSV: name, instrument)
2. Review unmatched parent registrations in dashboard
3. Manually link parents to students when fuzzy matching fails
4. Upload files to "Forms" category
5. Manage Google Calendar externally, configure calendar ID in system

### Parent Workflow
1. Register with student legal name and instrument
2. Get immediate feedback on student matching
3. Enroll students in payment categories (Band Fees, Spring Trip, Equipment)
4. Make payments in configured increments toward enrolled categories
5. View payment history and outstanding balances per student
6. View/download files and subscribe to calendar

### Guest Payment Workflow
1. Enter parent name, email, student name, and payment details
2. System performs strict student name matching against roster
3. If matched: process payment and link to student record
4. If unmatched: create unmatched payment for booster review
5. Receive payment confirmation email

### Booster Review Workflow
1. Review unmatched payments in dashboard
2. Search for correct student matches
3. Create ghost accounts for parents without existing accounts
4. Link payments to correct student records
5. Add resolution notes for audit trail

## Database Schema Priorities
- users (with stripe_customer_id and isGhostAccount flag)
- students (roster with fuzzy matching fields, includes special "General Fund" student)
- student_parent (parent-student relationships with status tracking)
- payment_categories (hardcoded: Band Fees, Spring Trip, Equipment with increment rules)
- student_payment_enrollments (tracks total_owed vs amount_paid per student/category)
- payments (individual payment records with optional notes)
- guest_payments (non-authenticated payments with optional notes)
- donations (General Fund payments with required notes)
- unmatched_payments (for booster review with resolution notes)
- files (metadata with category and deprecation status)

## White-Label Requirements
- School name, colors, contact info in config file
- Payment categories customizable per school
- Feature toggles for payments/files/calendar/analytics
- Easy Docker deployment with volume mounts
- Minimal technical knowledge required for new deployments

## Development Priorities
1. Core authentication and user management
2. Student-parent matching with director review system
3. Payment system with category self-selection
4. File upload/download with deprecation
5. Google Calendar integration
6. Admin dashboard with analytics
7. White-label configuration and deployment

## Security Considerations
- No student PII exposed in dropdowns or API responses
- Payment data handled entirely by Stripe
- File access restricted to authenticated users
- SQLite database secured through Docker volume mounts
- Director email notifications for manual review cases only
