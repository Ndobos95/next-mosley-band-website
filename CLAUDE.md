# Band Program Website Template - Claude Reference

## Tech Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript + shadcn/ui
- SQLite + Prisma ORM
- Better Auth authentication (parents and directors)
- Stripe payments (handles own emails)
- Umami analytics (self-hosted)
- Google Calendar integration
- Docker deployment

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Student-Parent Matching System
- **Privacy-first**: No student name dropdowns to prevent data leaks
- **Fuzzy matching**: Backend matches parent input against director's CSV roster
- **Real-time feedback**: "Match found!" or "Manual verification needed"
- **Director review**: Dashboard for unmatched registrations with manual linking

### Payment System Design
- **Self-selection**: Parents choose activity categories for their student
- **Partial payments**: Configurable per-category (Band Fees = 100%, Trip Payment = partial allowed)
- **Per-student tracking**: Individual payment history and status
- **Multi-student support**: Parents can manage multiple children

### Configuration Approach
- **File-based only**: JSON configuration for white-label customization
- **No web admin**: Director cannot change branding/settings through website
- **Developer setup**: Configuration changes require file editing and redeployment

### File Management
- **Simple model**: Director uploads, parents download
- **Category-based**: Starting with "Forms" category
- **Deprecation support**: Director can archive outdated files
- **No versioning**: Simple file replacement workflow

### Calendar Integration
- **External management**: Director maintains Google Calendar separately
- **Website display**: Embedded calendar view with subscription options
- **Public access**: Calendar viewable without login
- **No RSVP or event management**: Display and sync only

### Dashboard Architecture
- **Unified dashboard**: Single `/dashboard` URL for all authenticated users
- **Role-based content**: Different interfaces shown based on user role (parent vs director)
- **Server-side role detection**: User role determines which dashboard component renders
- **Seamless experience**: No confusion about where to go after login

## Important Workflows

### Director Workflow
1. Upload student roster (CSV: name, instrument)
2. Review unmatched parent registrations in dashboard
3. Manually link parents to students when fuzzy matching fails
4. Upload files to "Forms" category
5. Manage Google Calendar externally, configure calendar ID in system

### Parent Workflow
1. Register with student legal name and instrument
2. Get immediate feedback on student matching
3. Select payment categories for activities student participates in
4. Make full or partial payments based on category rules
5. View/download files and subscribe to calendar

## Database Schema Priorities
- user_students (parent-student relationships)
- payments (Stripe tracking with per-student categorization)
- students (roster with fuzzy matching fields)
- payment_categories (configurable with partial payment flags)
- files (metadata with category and deprecation status)

## White-Label Requirements
- School name, colors, contact info in config file
- Payment categories customizable per school
- Feature toggles for payments/files/calendar/analytics
- Easy Docker deployment with volume mounts
- Minimal technical knowledge required for new deployments

## Development Priorities
1. Core authentication and user management
2. Student-parent matching with director review system
3. Payment system with category self-selection
4. File upload/download with deprecation
5. Google Calendar integration
6. Admin dashboard with analytics
7. White-label configuration and deployment

## Security Considerations
- No student PII exposed in dropdowns or API responses
- Payment data handled entirely by Stripe
- File access restricted to authenticated users
- SQLite database secured through Docker volume mounts
- Director email notifications for manual review cases only
