# Band Program Website Template - Claude Reference

## Tech Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript + shadcn/ui
- SQLite + Prisma ORM
- Better Auth authentication (parents and directors)
- Stripe payments (handles own emails)
- Umami analytics (self-hosted)
- Google Calendar integration
- Docker deployment

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Student-Parent Matching System
- **Privacy-first**: No student name dropdowns to prevent data leaks
- **Fuzzy matching**: Backend matches parent input against director's CSV roster
- **Real-time feedback**: "Match found!" or "Manual verification needed"
- **Director review**: Dashboard for unmatched registrations with manual linking

### Payment System Design (t3dotgg Pattern)
- **t3dotgg Architecture**: Single source of truth with `syncStripeDataToUser()` function - no complex webhook state management
- **Stripe Checkout Sessions**: Pre-created customer IDs, hosted payment pages for PCI compliance
- **Two-step flow**: Parents enroll students in categories first, then make payments in configured increments
- **Payment increments**: Band Fees ($250 full), Spring Trip ($900 in $50 increments), Equipment ($150 in $25 increments)
- **Guest checkout support**: Non-authenticated users can make payments with strict student name matching
- **Ghost accounts**: Automatic account creation for unmatched payments, convertible to real accounts
- **Notes system**: Optional notes for student payments, required notes for donations
- **General Fund**: Special student record for handling donations and arbitrary contributions

### Configuration Approach
- **File-based only**: JSON configuration for white-label customization
- **No web admin**: Director cannot change branding/settings through website
- **Developer setup**: Configuration changes require file editing and redeployment

### File Management
- **Simple model**: Director uploads, parents download
- **Category-based**: Starting with "Forms" category
- **Deprecation support**: Director can archive outdated files
- **No versioning**: Simple file replacement workflow

### Calendar Integration
- **External management**: Director maintains Google Calendar separately
- **Website display**: Embedded calendar view with subscription options
- **Public access**: Calendar viewable without login
- **No RSVP or event management**: Display and sync only

### Dashboard Architecture
- **Unified dashboard**: Single `/dashboard` URL for all authenticated users
- **Role-based content**: Different interfaces shown based on user role (parent vs director)
- **Server-side role detection**: User role determines which dashboard component renders
- **Seamless experience**: No confusion about where to go after login

## Important Workflows

### Director Workflow
1. Upload student roster (CSV: name, instrument)
2. Review unmatched parent registrations in dashboard
3. Manually link parents to students when fuzzy matching fails
4. Upload files to "Forms" category
5. Manage Google Calendar externally, configure calendar ID in system

### Parent Workflow
1. Register with student legal name and instrument
2. Get immediate feedback on student matching
3. Enroll students in payment categories (Band Fees, Spring Trip, Equipment)
4. Make payments in configured increments toward enrolled categories
5. View payment history and outstanding balances per student
6. View/download files and subscribe to calendar

### Guest Payment Workflow (Webhook-Free)
**High Confidence Match (≥0.8 fuzzy match confidence):**
1. Guest enters parent name, email, student name, and payment details
2. System performs fuzzy matching against student roster
3. **Immediately create**: Ghost account + StudentParent relationship + StudentPaymentEnrollment record
4. Create Stripe Checkout Session with ghost account customer ID
5. **Later sync** (when admin views data) links Stripe payment to existing enrollment
6. Payment appears correctly in admin dashboard with proper totals

**Low Confidence Match (<0.8 confidence):**
1. Guest enters payment details, system finds poor/no match
2. **Store in GuestPayment table only** (no ghost account yet)
3. Create Stripe Checkout Session for guest checkout
4. **Booster manual resolution**: Review unmatched payment, select correct student
5. **Resolution creates**: Ghost account + enrollment for selected student
6. **Later sync** links payment to enrollment

### Booster Review Workflow
1. **Dashboard Categorization**: Payments categorized by student matching status:
   - **Needs Review**: Payments with no matched student (regardless of payment status)
   - **Resolved**: Payments with matched student (auto-matched or manually resolved)
2. **Manual Resolution**: Review unmatched payments, select correct student from dropdown
3. **Ghost Account Creation**: Creates ghost account + enrollment for selected student  
4. **Audit Trail**: Resolution notes and timestamps for all manual interventions

## Database Schema Priorities
- users (with stripe_customer_id and isGhostAccount flag)
- students (roster with fuzzy matching fields, includes special "General Fund" student)
- student_parent (parent-student relationships with status tracking)
- payment_categories (hardcoded: Band Fees, Spring Trip, Equipment with increment rules)
- student_payment_enrollments (tracks total_owed vs amount_paid per student/category)
- payments (individual payment records with optional notes)
- guest_payments (non-authenticated payments with optional notes)
- donations (General Fund payments with required notes)
- unmatched_payments (for booster review with resolution notes)
- files (metadata with category and deprecation status)

## White-Label Requirements
- School name, colors, contact info in config file
- Payment categories customizable per school
- Feature toggles for payments/files/calendar/analytics
- Easy Docker deployment with volume mounts
- Minimal technical knowledge required for new deployments

## Development Priorities
1. Core authentication and user management
2. Student-parent matching with director review system
3. Payment system with category self-selection
4. File upload/download with deprecation
5. Google Calendar integration
6. Admin dashboard with analytics
7. White-label configuration and deployment

## Security Considerations
- No student PII exposed in dropdowns or API responses
- Payment data handled entirely by Stripe
- File access restricted to authenticated users
- SQLite database secured through Docker volume mounts
- Director email notifications for manual review cases only

### Phase 4: Payment System ✅ CORE SYSTEM COMPLETED 
**Implementation Strategy: t3dotgg Pattern with Stripe Checkout Sessions**

**📚 Reference: t3dotgg Stripe Recommendations**
- **Source**: https://github.com/t3dotgg/stripe-recommendations
- **Key Principle**: Single source of truth with `syncStripeDataToUser()` function
- **Pattern**: Avoid complex webhook state management, use simple cache sync approach
- **Architecture**: Pre-create Stripe customers, use Checkout Sessions, cache all data in one JSON blob per user

**✅ COMPLETED - Core Payment Flow (Tasks 1-7)**
1. **✅ Database schema foundation** - Stripe fields added to User model (`stripeCustomerId`, `isGuestAccount`) + StripeCache table for t3dotgg pattern
2. **✅ Stripe dependencies & environment** - Packages installed (`stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`), env vars configured, validation added to startup.ts  
3. **✅ Core t3dotgg sync architecture** - Complete `syncStripeDataToUser()` function implemented with checkout session metadata mapping, `createStripeCustomerForUser()` built, TypeScript interfaces defined
4. **✅ Payment category enrollment system** - Two-step flow implemented: enroll first, pay later with hardcoded categories (Band Fees $250, Spring Trip $900 in $50 increments, Equipment $150 in $25 increments)
5. **✅ Stripe Checkout integration** - Hosted payment pages with incremental payment support using Checkout Sessions, payment UI with multiple increment options
6. **✅ Webhook-free architecture** - No webhook complexity, all payments use consistent sync pattern
7. **✅ Payment history dashboard** - Complete payment tracking with student details, categories, and status badges

**✅ COMPLETED - Guest & Oversight Features**
8. **✅ Guest checkout system** - Webhook-free guest payments with immediate ghost account creation
9. **✅ Ghost account creation** - Automatic accounts for matched payments, manual creation for unmatched
10. **🔄 Booster review dashboard** - Manual resolution of unmatched payments with ghost account creation
11. **🔄 Donation system** - General Fund integration with required notes (future enhancement)

**🎯 Current Status - Production Ready System**
- **✅ Complete authenticated parent payment flow**: Registration → Enrollment → Payment → History
- **✅ Complete guest payment system**: Webhook-free with immediate ghost account creation
- **✅ Admin oversight dashboards**: Correct payment categorization and manual resolution
- **✅ Real-time UI updates**: Progress bars, enrollment status, payment buttons with loading states
- **✅ t3dotgg sync pattern**: All payments use consistent sync approach, no webhook complexity
- **✅ Bug fixes applied**: Payment double-counting, dashboard categorization, enrollment creation
- **✅ Build validation passes**: All TypeScript compilation successful

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **NO STRIPE WEBHOOKS**: Webhooks are complex, unreliable, and unnecessary for this use case
- Use Stripe Checkout Sessions (not Payment Intents) for PCI compliance and simplicity
- **t3dotgg sync pattern for ALL payments**: Authenticated users sync on dashboard load, ghost accounts sync when accessed
- Hardcoded payment categories: Band Fees ($250 full), Spring Trip ($900 in $50 increments), Equipment ($150 in $25 increments)
- Lazy Stripe customer creation (on first enrollment attempt, not registration)
- **Immediate ghost account creation**: For matched guest payments (confidence ≥0.8), create accounts before Stripe processing
- Notes optional for student payments, required for donations
- Ghost accounts auto-link siblings by last name matching

**🐛 Critical Bug Fixes Applied:**

**1. Guest Payment Enrollment Creation**
- **Issue**: Guest payments weren't creating enrollment records, causing incorrect "total owed" calculations
- **Root Cause**: Webhook dependency failed to create database records for matched payments
- **Solution**: Webhook-free immediate ghost account + enrollment creation for high-confidence matches
- **Result**: Guest payments now show correct totals in admin dashboard

**2. Payment Double-Counting**
- **Issue**: David Brown showed $500 total paid instead of $250
- **Root Cause**: Admin API counted both enrollment.amountPaid AND resolved guest payment amounts
- **Solution**: Filter out resolved guest payments (those with resolvedAt timestamp) from totals
- **Result**: Accurate payment totals, no double-counting

**3. Booster Dashboard Categorization**
- **Issue**: Unmatched guest payments appeared in "Resolved" tab instead of "Needs Review"
- **Root Cause**: Flawed filtering logic that categorized non-completed payments as "resolved"
- **Solution**: Simplified logic based on student matching status, not payment status
- **Result**: Correct categorization - unmatched = needs review, matched = resolved

4. **Track progress** with real-time progress bars and payment history
5. **View complete payment history** with student details and transaction status

**✅ Technical Foundation Complete:**
- User model extended with `stripeCustomerId` and `isGuestAccount` fields
- StripeCache table with t3dotgg JSON data pattern
- Stripe packages: `stripe` (server), `@stripe/stripe-js` (client)
- Environment variables: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**✅ Key Files Implemented:**
- `src/lib/stripe.ts` - Stripe server configuration
- `src/types/stripe.ts` - Complete TypeScript interfaces for enrollment & payments
- `src/lib/stripe-cache.ts` - t3dotgg implementation with checkout session metadata mapping

- Real-time enrollment status updates and progress tracking

## 🎓 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE LESSONS LEARNED

### **Database as Single Source of Truth**
**Issue Discovered:** Payment totals showed $0 in admin dashboard despite working correctly in parent dashboard.

**Root Cause:** 
- Parent dashboard used StripeCache JSON (correct amounts)
- Admin dashboard used database tables (always $0 because never updated)
- `enrollStudentInCategory()` only updated Stripe metadata, never created database records

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Database is ALWAYS the source of truth** - All application logic should read from database tables
2. **Stripe is the upstream source** - Database must be synced from Stripe data, not the other way around
3. **JSON cache is for convenience only** - StripeCache should supplement, not replace database queries
4. **Dual-write pattern required** - Every operation must update both Stripe AND database consistently

### **Proper t3dotgg Implementation**
**Corrected Pattern:**
```typescript
// WRONG: Only update cache
await updateStripeCustomerMetadata(enrollments)

// RIGHT: Update database AND cache
await createDatabaseEnrollmentRecord(studentId, categoryId, totalOwed)
await updateStripeCustomerMetadata(enrollments)
await syncStripeDataToUser(userId) // Ensures database stays current
```

### **Enum/Category Name Consistency**
**Issue:** Mixed usage of enum keys vs display names across codebase
- Stripe metadata: `'BAND_FEES'` (enum key)
- Database lookups: `'Band Fees'` (display name)
- This caused sync failures and data inconsistencies

**Solution:** Single source of truth for category definitions:
```typescript
export const PAYMENT_CATEGORIES = {
  BAND_FEES: { name: 'Band Fees', totalAmount: 25000 },
  // Always use categoryConfig.name for database operations
}
```

### **Data Flow Architecture**
**Correct Flow:**
1. **User Action** → API endpoint
2. **Database Write** → Create/update records in database tables
3. **Stripe Sync** → Update Stripe customer metadata  
4. **Cache Refresh** → Sync latest Stripe data back to database
5. **UI Display** → Read from database tables (single source of truth)

### **Debugging Best Practices**
When payment/enrollment data shows inconsistencies:
1. **Check database records first** - Do `StudentPaymentEnrollment` records exist?
2. **Verify sync functions** - Are database updates happening in enrollment/payment flows?
3. **Trace enum usage** - Are category names consistent between Stripe and database?
4. **Add comprehensive logging** - Log both Stripe data AND database lookups

### **Critical Development Rules**
1. **Never read from cache for business logic** - Always query database tables
2. **Always dual-write** - Update database AND Stripe in every operation
3. **Use single enum source** - Reference `PAYMENT_CATEGORIES[key].name` consistently
4. **Test admin views** - They often reveal database sync issues that parent views hide

### 🎯 NEXT PRIORITIES - Guest Payment & Oversight Features

**Remaining Tasks (Phase 4 completion):**
1. **Guest checkout system** - Non-authenticated payments with student name matching
2. **Ghost account creation** - Auto-create accounts for unmatched guest payments  
3. **Booster review dashboard** - Manual resolution interface for unmatched payments
4. **Donation system** - General Fund integration with required notes

**Alternative Next Phases:**
- **Phase 5: File Management** - Director upload system, parent downloads
- **Phase 6: Google Calendar** - Calendar integration and subscription  
- **Phase 7: Analytics & Reporting** - Umami analytics, payment reporting
- **Phase 8: White-label Deployment** - Configuration system, Docker optimization
